E: Hi I’m Emily!
Ta: I’m Tanya!
To: And I’m Tonye!
E: Today we’re going to talk about Type Inferencing in functional languages.

Slide 2
E: We've all seen a line of code like this many times over in languages like Java or c++. When we have type inferencing though, we don't need to declare x or y as an int. The program does it for us. 

To: Type inferencing is a common feature, paricularly in functional languages. You can see it in languages like Haskell, Swift, and more.

Slide 3
To: What we're doing is working with a toy language to experiment with algorithm M. 

Ta: Normally in type inferencing, the language uses algorithm W to infer the types, which works top down. Algorithm M on the other hand, works bottom up.

Slide 4
E: As we mentioned, we're working with a toy language which is in Haskell and only uses expressions. Here you can see the different things an expression can be.

Slides 5 & 6
Ta: Evaluation rules explantions.  
Each of these rules corresponds to one of the possibilities for an expression.
The first one corresponds to a constant literal.  The type of a constant literal is just whatever type is indicated by the literal.
So if the literal is a number, then in our language, the type must be an integer.  If the literal is a string, then it's a string.

The next one corresponds to a variable expression.  In order to know what 
the type of a variable is, we look it up in the surrounding context to see
what it previous definitions made it.  Then we have to compare the previous
definitions to whatever the immediate context of the variable is now telling
us.  Perhaps it is an argument to a function.  The input type of the 
function must the type of the variable.

Then we have the function and function application expressions.  
This is where inferencing gets really interesting.  In the case of the
function, we need to check that its implied type from surrounding context,
whether a type signature or something else, is in fact a function type.
Then we check the body of the expression for its type and match it up with
the argument type.

The application of the function requires that the first expression actually
be a function, and that the input type of the function matches the argument
given.  Additionally, the whole expression must match its context.

Slide 7
To: And now for a short demonstartion.

(the examples are called example1, example2, example3, ... 
the inference results are called test1, test2, test3, ...
just run these in ghci)
