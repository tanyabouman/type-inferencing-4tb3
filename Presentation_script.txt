E: Today we’re going to talk about Type Inferencing in functional languages.

Slide 2
E: We've all seen a line of code like this many times over in languages, like Java or c++. When we have type inferencing though, we don't need to declare x as an int. The program does it for us. 

To: Type inferencing is a common feature, paricularly in functional languages. You can see it in languages like Haskell, Swift, and more.
