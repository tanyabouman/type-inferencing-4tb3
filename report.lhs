\section{Introduction}
Type inferencing can be defined as the compile-time process of reconstructing missing type information in a program
based on the use of some of its variables.\cite{duggan_bent_1996}
Many advanced languages, such as Swift\cite{swifttypedocs} and Haskell\cite{haskelltypedocs},
allow programmers to skip defining the types of variables, by doing type inferencing at compile time.
Others, like Python, also allow the programmer to avoid defining
the type of a variable, but these types are dynamic\cite{pythonsummary}, 
and therefore not the topic of the currrent report.
Languages that use type inferencing use the Hindley-Milner type system, which has two main implementations, Algorithm W and Algorithm M.

\subsection{History}
Algorithm W is standard algorithm, proposed by MIlner\cite{algwstepbystep}, while Algorithm M was not formally presented until 1998 by Oukseh Lee and Kwangkeun Yi\cite{Lee:1998:PFL:291891.291892}. Algorithm W is an algorithm that works bottom to top.
This means that if a syntax tree were built from a piece of code, types would be inferred starting from the bottom. Algorithm M
is the exact inverse of Algorithm W. Types are inferred from the top of the syntax tree down.


\section{Our Work}
Because Algorithm W is the more popular and more commonly used algorithm, we decided to work with Algorithm M. To do our work, we
have created a toy language, and rules for that language, that demonstrate type inferencing and Algorithm M.

\subsection{Our Toy Language}

The toy language for the purpose of this project is a
small portion of Haskell, allowing only the types
\texttt{Int}, \texttt{Bool}, \texttt{String} and functions
on those types.  Later on in this report, we extend
the language to also include type variables, but these
are not constrained by type classes.

\subsection{Inferencing}

Let's assume that a parser has already produced a syntax tree, of type
\texttt{Expression}, as given below.
The \texttt{Type} that is given from the parser is the type given in the
annotation.  The annotation might or might not be correct. The type
inferencing algorithm will detect that.

\section{Conclusion}

To conclude, type inferencing is a very interesting feature in the programming world. It uses Algorithms M
or W to infer the types of variables when undeclared at compile time, thus enabling the programmer to be faster.
Our example toy language shows how Algorithm M and the type inferencing system work. In the future, it would be 
interesting to see if type inferencing could be applied across all languages.
